1
00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:01,882
Previously on "The 100"...

2
00:00:02,047 --> 00:00:03,406
The valley is ours.

3
00:00:03,531 --> 00:00:06,416
As long as you stay here,
we won't have a problem.

4
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:08,399
The hydrofarm is barely feeding us now.

5
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,107
So if this is the last
living valley on the Earth,

6
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:13,260
then it should be ours.

7
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:15,375
Diyoza thinks the same thing.

8
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:16,993
And so we fight.

9
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,766
Oh, my God, they're breeding them.

10
00:00:21,036 --> 00:00:22,568
You're gonna suck today.

11
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:24,771
No one can think that you'd
make a good Commander.

12
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:27,307
- Yaah! uh!
- Yaah!

13
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:30,358
Madi, I could really use a second.

14
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,440
What do you say?

15
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:33,495
I have a question for Colonel Diyoza.

16
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,615
What would it take for
you to share the valley?

17
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:37,530
Short of an unconditional surrender.

18
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:40,070
- Nothing.
- Octavia will never surrender.

19
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:42,595
That's why we're gonna take her out.

20
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:48,395
I don't care how you
make it happen, Clarke.

21
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:50,564
Kill Octavia is you have to.

22
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:53,066
Bring her to me in chains,
and I'll do it for you,

23
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:55,502
or she can surrender herself,

24
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:58,298
but your red queen doesn't
seem like the type.

25
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:02,309
Let us worry about that.

26
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,744
We have an understanding, then.

27
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:08,167
- We do.
- Good.

28
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:09,749
Call me back when it's done,

29
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:12,222
and we can work out the
details of your crossing.

30
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,549
Over and out.

31
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,422
- No way.
- Bellamy...

32
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:18,225
We are not killing my sister, Clarke.

33
00:01:18,227 --> 00:01:20,594
I don't care how crazy she is.

34
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:22,754
Run the loop. The rover's charged.

35
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:24,898
We're getting our friends.

36
00:01:25,606 --> 00:01:27,200
That was reckless.

37
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:30,269
We had a plan. You agreed.

38
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:33,828
That was before Octavia
made Madi her second.

39
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:36,276
That army marches to war

40
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:38,812
as soon as they find
out the eye is down.

41
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:41,671
- I can't let that happen.
- So we don't tell anyone?

42
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:43,272
They'll know as soon as we drive away.

43
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:45,215
Oh, who cares? We grab Madi, and we go.

44
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:46,686
Bellamy, she's by her side.

45
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:49,110
- She's my sister, Clarke.
- I know.

46
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:51,258
Tell me what else to do.

47
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,269
- We stop the war.
- How?

48
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,529
- Algae.
- Monty...

49
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:57,682
Cooper already gave me

50
00:01:57,688 --> 00:01:59,081
permission to show what it can do.

51
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:00,697
She's meeting me before
the afternoon meal

52
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,845
- so I can take her to the...
- That's enough.

53
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:03,373
- Hey, give it back.
- Monty, Bellamy's right.

54
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:05,700
Cooper's worse than Octavia.

55
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:08,069
No offense.

56
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:10,689
Besides, the first batch put Murphy

57
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,407
in a coma for almost a week.

58
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,775
- By the time it's ready to eat...
- The first culture,

59
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:16,103
and we're not gonna eat it this time.

60
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,580
We're gonna feed it to the plants.

61
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:19,031
If I can make the farm viable again,

62
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:21,070
then we'll still have a chance.

63
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,659
The spy did her job?

64
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:31,458
Uh, we were just about to send for you.

65
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:33,806
Told you Echo would get it done.

66
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:35,946
Can the enemy still see us?

67
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,903
For now, yes. It's technical, but...

68
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,319
He has to run a loop to
mask our troop movements.

69
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,288
When the time comes, we
need to clear the surface

70
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,089
to reduce the risk of anyone noticing

71
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,291
the same people moving in

72
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:48,976
the same direction again and again.

73
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,504
Well done, Monty.

74
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,820
Load the worms into the rover

75
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:01,265
and mobilize the army.

76
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:05,542
War is here.

00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:53,023
He's all yours, Colonel.

79
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,705
Thank you, Robert.

80
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,080
Going somewhere, Kane?

81
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,363
Do I need permission for that?

82
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:01,876
- Yes.
- Ok.

83
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,201
I was going to the Southwest quadrant

84
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,936
to map out a settlement.

85
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,067
Just breathe, Robert.

86
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,908
It's ok.

87
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,944
Comes and goes. I'll be fine.

88
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:15,746
Damn right you will.

89
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:17,547
New Doc's working on a cure.

90
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,080
Why not give him something for the pain?

91
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:23,787
Meanwhile, why don't
you get off your feet?

92
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,223
You look like hell.

93
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:27,621
Thank you, Colonel.

94
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,917
List of the people you killed?

95
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:41,724
For that, I need a bigger notebook.

96
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,040
Why am I here, Colonel?

97
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:46,618
I got an interesting
call on the radio...

98
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,490
Abby's daughter.

99
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,757
Clarke radioed?

100
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:51,688
Why?

101
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:54,522
I think she may try and
kill your red queen.

102
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:56,420
She'll get killed.

103
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:59,556
Maybe, but I told her once it's done

104
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:00,957
and Wonkru surrenders...

105
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,459
Do you read me?

106
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:04,194
We'll share this valley.

107
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:07,097
Testing, testing for the 200th time.

108
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,838
This is John Murphy.

109
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:10,557
That's John Murphy.

110
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,172
- Let me talk to him.
- Just wait.

111
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:17,307
Testing, testing.

112
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:19,443
This is John Murphy looking
for Colonel Diyoza.

113
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:20,706
Do you read me?

114
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,783
Well, it's safe to say you're better

115
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,152
at blowing things up than fixing them.

116
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:34,492
This is Colonel Diyoza.
What do you want?

117
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,879
Be strong, direct, unrelenting.

118
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:42,695
We have McCreary.

119
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,337
You ever want to see him alive again,

120
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,162
you give us Raven Reyes.

121
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,667
You know him.

122
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,815
Will he follow through?

123
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,222
Probably.

124
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:58,014
Colonel, if you don't make the trade,

125
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:00,468
- McCreary's people...
- Become my people.

126
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,563
You should have learned the last time

127
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,457
you held my people hostage

128
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:10,026
that I don't negotiate with terrorists.

129
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:13,029
That's funny coming from you.

130
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:16,533
Last chance, our hostage for yours.

131
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,264
May God have mercy on his soul.

132
00:06:25,878 --> 00:06:28,636
Two radio calls, two problems solved.

133
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:31,777
What are the odds?

134
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:36,052
That could've gone better.

135
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:39,089
Call me when he's awake.
I need some air.

136
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:43,219
Come on, Kane.

137
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:45,125
Without graveyard McCreary,

138
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:48,316
my internal problem is solved.

139
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:52,004
Without the Red Queen,
our problem external is.

140
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:54,552
This is how we get to peace.

141
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:58,074
Is it? Because from where I'm standing,

142
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:01,522
it looks like we're trading
one dictator for another...

143
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:05,688
Political assassinations, torture,

144
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:07,884
wrongful imprisonment.

145
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,560
This is about me giving Abby pills.

146
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:11,388
You mean, feeding an addict's addiction

147
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,889
to save your people's lives

148
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,596
without a thought for the
life you're destroying?

149
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,125
Yes. It is.

150
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,429
I've seen the horrors
we inflict on each other

151
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:21,865
in the name of survival, Colonel.

152
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:25,587
God knows I'm as guilty as anyone,

153
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,269
but we're on the brink here,

154
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:31,832
on the edge of an abyss I've stared

155
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:33,507
into before, and I can tell you,

156
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,042
having sacrificed the few to save

157
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:38,287
the many more times
than I care to admit,

158
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:42,352
eventually, the few becomes the many.

159
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,022
The ends don't always justify the means,

160
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:47,904
and if you don't know that by now

161
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,827
after everything you've been through...

162
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:57,673
Then you're just as bad as Octavia...

163
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:01,265
And we're already lost.

164
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:20,924
That's a fair amount of
abscesses, isn't it, Doctor?

165
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:28,338
Wait.

166
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,478
- Did you feel that?
- Feel what?

167
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:34,301
One of the abscesses broke apart.

168
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:36,173
It was the sound waves.

169
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:38,633
I'm sure of it.

170
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:41,511
I can dissolve them

171
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:44,733
and then suction out the residue. Huh.

172
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,951
I just need more power.

173
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,592
Vinson, where are you going?

174
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:57,409
Inspiration loves company.

175
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:04,431
- I'll take that if you don't mind.
- Hey, man.

176
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,917
A sonic drill.

177
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:16,637
It uses sound waves to pulverize rock.

178
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:20,729
That's a good idea, Vinson,

179
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:23,071
but unless there's a
prisoner at this camp

180
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:24,775
that's an engineer, there's...

181
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:28,415
Yaagh! Please...

182
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:29,800
Turn it up a little bit.

183
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:33,089
Eegh! Ugh! Uh!

184
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:38,735
Raven, no. It's not your fight.

185
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:40,236
It's our fault he's here.

186
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:42,272
I know you're angry,
but you said yourself

187
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:43,740
they can't kill him.

188
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:45,595
He's the only person who...

189
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,744
We have to kill him.

190
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,013
No way.

191
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,615
Raven, that ship is their
biggest strategic advantage.

192
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:56,920
Without a pilot to fly...

193
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:58,776
I said no.

194
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,724
- Listen to me.
- There's nothing you have to say

195
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,482
- that I could possibly...
- My friend Echo wants to kill you

196
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:19,718
so they have no one to fly the ship.

197
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:22,732
If you tell Diyoza, I'll deny it.

198
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,771
We're readying for war.

199
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,014
Do you know the risk I'm
taking meeting you here?

200
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,476
- Yes. Thank you for coming.
- What do you want?

201
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,478
I talked to Colonel Diyoza.

202
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:49,606
She's offering all of Wonkru

203
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:51,315
safe passage to the valley.

204
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,517
All Octavia has to do is surrender.

205
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,252
As it's by now you've realized

206
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,485
she would never do that,
I'll ask you again.

207
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,707
What do you want from me?

208
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:00,492
Peace without war is still possible.

209
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,494
Now, you're her advisor.
She'll listen to you.

210
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,063
Why would I advise her to surrender

211
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:05,976
in a war she's likely to win?

212
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,933
Thanks to you, we can march freely

213
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,601
on the enemy while the
worms ravage them.

214
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,193
By the time we get to the valley,

215
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:13,633
the only thing left to do
will be to clean up the mess.

216
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:15,865
And if the worms ravage the valley?

217
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:18,504
A risk she's willing to take.

218
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,454
- Are you?
- It's not up to me.

219
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,683
- What if it was?
- Clarke...

220
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,809
I will not help you kill my leader.

221
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:27,973
Neither will I.

222
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,829
What if the outcome of
the war wasn't certain,

223
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:31,523
if she didn't have the worms?

224
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,858
Would she still fight?

225
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,426
If she didn't have the worms,

226
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,872
- both sides would take heavy losses.
- Exactly.

227
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:38,561
If all it took to save
her people from that

228
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:40,435
and deliver them to the promised land

229
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,938
was surrender, would she do it?

230
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,606
I would hope so.

231
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:46,870
Of course, you would never
see the promised land

232
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:48,491
because she would know it was you

233
00:11:48,497 --> 00:11:50,397
and, brother or not,
throw you in the pits.

234
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:52,173
Not if she thought it was Cooper.

235
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:56,517
There's a failsafe in
the processing room...

236
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,152
I saw it when I was there...

237
00:11:58,154 --> 00:11:59,954
A way to kill the worms if they ever...

238
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:02,523
Folly! Cooper would
never push that button,

239
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,659
and since she's the only one
that handles the worms...

240
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,607
Cooper would be dead.

241
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,631
We'll make it look like an accident.

242
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:13,368
You would be the first responder.

243
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,703
You would hit the failsafe button.

244
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:18,206
No more worms.

245
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:24,206
No more war.

246
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,256
We know that there are

247
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:36,892
3 entry points to the valley.

248
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:39,659
While Cooper, Madi, and
I soften the battlefield,

249
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:41,164
Miller will lead the first battalion

250
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,833
through the Southern tributary.

251
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,869
- First?
- You have a problem with that?

252
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:48,371
No, but the first battalion's Indra's.

253
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:50,040
Not anymore.

254
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:52,439
It's fine, Nathan. You're prepared.

255
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,493
All right. Madi, come here by me.

256
00:12:58,617 --> 00:13:00,817
Cooper, the floor is yours.

257
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:02,619
Worms are thermoreceptors.

258
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:04,654
That means they sense body heat.

259
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,423
With Madi's knowledge of the woods,

260
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:08,125
we'll get as close to
the village as we can

261
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:11,328
and release them here, here,

262
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,108
and here.

263
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,410
Which one of you is Raven Reyes?

264
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:34,184
Why is he wearing a collar?

265
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:36,955
- You don't want to know.
- Tell me.

266
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,342
Serial killer.

267
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:40,836
He kept his victims' hands
and feet as mementos.

268
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:43,370
Other than that, he's a nice guy.

269
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:44,723
Hmm.

270
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:48,106
What's this about, Vinson?

271
00:13:48,343 --> 00:13:51,144
Collar looks good on you, Shaw.

272
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:54,525
Yours has been tagged to
another facility for the day.

273
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:58,228
Now walk with me.

274
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,829
I'll be ok.

275
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,509
- Good.
- Hey, man.

276
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:31,782
Abby. Oh...

277
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:36,490
Thank you, Vinson.

278
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:45,805
I've been here for days.

279
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:48,375
You're not collared.

280
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:54,206
I saw Kane. Why haven't I seen you?

281
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:56,184
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:57,212 --> 00:15:01,114
Echo said you defected
because of Octavia.

283
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:05,848
Did they tell you why you are here?

284
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:08,722
No.

285
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:10,608
The miners are sick.

286
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,265
I know. The hythylodium.

287
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:14,895
Listen. I think I can cure them.

288
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:18,198
I need you to be able to
take the power from this

289
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:21,201
and make it come out of this.

290
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:24,250
No. If they're dying, let them.

291
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:29,281
Raven, I'm a doctor. I cannot do that.

292
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:32,913
Now please just tell me if
it's even at all possible.

293
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:35,924
Sure. It's possible,
but I'm not doing it.

294
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,390
Raven, please.

295
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:41,341
I need this to work.

296
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,491
Abby, what aren't you telling me?

297
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:49,710
Did Diyoza threaten to hurt you?

298
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,421
I don't like it, but

299
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:04,811
I'll see what I can do.

300
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,989
I admit it.

301
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,667
I'm impressed.

302
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,346
Your mother would be proud, Monty.

303
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,836
I told you.

304
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,238
It's the nitrogen,

305
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,057
and that took less than a day.

306
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:35,754
In a week, the entire farm could be...

307
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,246
You don't want to do that.

308
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:41,734
The first culture,
even from an old strain

309
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,550
like this, isn't safe.

310
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,018
I mean, it is for the plants,

311
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,519
but on the ring,

312
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,655
it put one of my friends in a coma.

313
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,646
I'll keep that in mind.

314
00:16:53,528 --> 00:16:55,353
Monty, here's the truth.

315
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,330
We leave in a few hours.

316
00:16:57,332 --> 00:16:59,933
After that, I don't ever want
to see this place again.

317
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,992
If you want to take it over,

318
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:03,944
be my guest.

319
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,624
If you'll excuse me...

320
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,009
You don't have to leave.

321
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:12,545
Look. That's the point.
No one else has to die.

322
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:16,230
You did things to survive.
That's in the past.

323
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:19,552
We can have protein
and biofuel and beer.

324
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:21,187
Yeah. It tastes like crap,

325
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:23,890
but who cares if it gets you drunk?

326
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,126
Is someone there?

327
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:37,604
Mm! Uh!

328
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:38,738
Bellamy!

329
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:46,880
Monty, come on.

330
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:48,348
We need you to open the processing room.

331
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,582
What the hell are you doing?

332
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:50,769
Explain later.

333
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:52,619
Actually, if you want
me to open that door,

334
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:53,853
you'll explain now.

335
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,889
I know it doesn't look like it,

336
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,590
but this is how we stop the war.

337
00:17:57,592 --> 00:17:58,992
I was stopping the war.

338
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,394
Keep your voice down.
If anyone hears us...

339
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:03,394
You're killing her, aren't you?

340
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:04,800
Yes.

341
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:09,035
If you don't open that door,

342
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:11,260
we're the ones who get killed.

343
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:16,436
Open it, Monty.

344
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,612
And, of course, I help

345
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:22,331
because what's one more, right?

346
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:25,085
- We're already murders.
- That's not fair.

347
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:27,876
We're talking about taking
one life to save hundreds.

348
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:30,121
Really? Then let's kill Octavia.

349
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:36,095
Didn't think so.

350
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,868
Monty...

351
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:54,681
We're doing the right thing.

352
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:56,598
If you say it enough,

353
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,453
maybe I'll believe you.

354
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,811
Looks like I should have killed you

355
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,650
when I had the chance.

356
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,767
Yeah? Well, I'm hard to kill.

357
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:50,804
Emori, he's up.

358
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:56,243
Getting blown up must suck, huh?

359
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:59,013
No. Chronic lung disease is worse.

360
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:01,204
I'll take your word for it.

361
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,977
Emori!

362
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:05,786
The bomb was clever, though.

363
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:09,790
Yeah. It was. Rocket fuel.

364
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,059
You should see what hythylodium does

365
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:13,824
when it's weaponized.

366
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:17,798
I could use someone like you on my crew.

367
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,183
Now, see, that's funny to me

368
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,085
because your crew doesn't seem

369
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,753
to miss you much at all.

370
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,522
We offered to trade you for Raven,

371
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,617
yet here you still are.

372
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,929
Diyoza said no.

373
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,475
Well, actually, I believe
her exact words were,

374
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:37,968
"may God have mercy on his soul."

375
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:45,299
I can help you

376
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:47,844
get Raven back.

377
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:55,137
I'm listening.

378
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,501
Thanks, Cash. Wait here.

379
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:22,095
I've been fighting the abuse of power

380
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:23,748
my whole life, Kane.

381
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,015
I'm no dictator.

382
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:27,616
I want to see an end to the violence

383
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:28,827
just as badly as you.

384
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,105
Yet those weren't exactly
civil engineering plans

385
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:32,944
I saw in your notebook, were they?

386
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,538
Page after page of battle strategies.

387
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,319
Defense strategies.

388
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:40,022
I'm not preparing for war.

389
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:42,124
I'm planning for peace.
There's a difference.

390
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:45,095
Maybe so, but until you recognize

391
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:48,333
that we're all just people,

392
00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:51,905
all this will ever be is a battlefield.

393
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,960
Kane, wait.

394
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:02,077
Tell me what we're looking at.

395
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:04,446
I don't think we'd see it the same way,

396
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,668
but all right.

397
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:07,341
That's where the trading post'll be,

398
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:09,867
and next to it, there'll be a farm

399
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:12,570
and a workshop

400
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:14,780
and a mill...

401
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:21,530
And a real medical center for Abby.

402
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:25,667
To the south, there'll be homes

403
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:28,704
dug out of the ground
to preserve the trees,

404
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:31,240
and at the center, there'll be a well,

405
00:22:31,242 --> 00:22:34,502
place for people to gather, talk,

406
00:22:35,384 --> 00:22:37,546
debate ideas.

407
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:40,630
And a school with a playground

408
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,706
where kids can blow off steam

409
00:22:42,712 --> 00:22:45,145
and bitch about their teachers

410
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:48,035
and kiss under the bleachers.

411
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:53,320
My kid.

412
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,230
How far along?

413
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,818
A hundred years and 5 months,

414
00:23:08,906 --> 00:23:10,872
give or take.

415
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:13,111
Abby says she's healthy.

416
00:23:13,117 --> 00:23:14,558
A girl?

417
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:22,882
Was that a kick?

418
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:26,484
Thank you, Kane.

419
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:28,235
For what?

420
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:31,929
Until I met you, the thought
of raising a child in

421
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,046
a world like this...

422
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:39,971
You give me hope.

423
00:23:42,441 --> 00:23:44,007
Hope.

424
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:48,841
That's a good name.

425
00:23:49,954 --> 00:23:51,528
It is, isn't it?

426
00:23:53,507 --> 00:23:54,832
Hope.

427
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,817
What?

428
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:30,766
Oh, no. No. No. No.

429
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,611
You'll both die for this.

430
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:38,004
Oh! Nngh!

431
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:41,613
Uh! No! Uh uh!

432
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:45,702
Rrgh! Aah!

433
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:55,521
Please make it stop. Aah!

434
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:01,449
Aah!

435
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:04,055
Let's go. It'll work.

436
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:06,013
Octavia will have to surrender.

437
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:07,325
Please make it stop!

438
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:08,653
This is how we get to peace.

439
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:13,886
Aagh! Why?

440
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:17,706
Aah!

441
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,799
Drop the gun.

442
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,666
- I said, drop your weapon.
- Oh, oh, hey, easy, easy, easy.

443
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:47,072
It's not loaded.

444
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:50,045
Why don't you take a minute

445
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:52,260
to explain our arrangement?

446
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,361
Emori.

447
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:01,454
Tell me you didn't make
a deal with the man

448
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:04,369
who tortured you and
hunted you like an animal.

449
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:05,546
- I did.
- John!

450
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:07,548
This is how we save Raven.

451
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,715
How?

452
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:10,551
Walk right in the front
door as his prisoners.

453
00:26:10,557 --> 00:26:13,231
They'll collar us to make it
look real, but I figure...

454
00:26:15,144 --> 00:26:16,691
I know how to take them off.

455
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:18,201
Mm-hmm.

456
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:20,995
Hmm, I don't know.

457
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:23,602
- We killed two of his people.
- Look, Emori.

458
00:26:23,608 --> 00:26:24,788
I don't trust the guy, either,

459
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:26,046
but we want the same thing.

460
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:28,159
- What?
- To survive.

461
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:32,170
Come on. We zip in, we
get Raven, we zip out.

462
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:34,425
We get the others after, ok?

463
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:38,730
Ok. I'm in.

464
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:40,500
Good.

465
00:26:43,294 --> 00:26:45,515
That's all I'm in for, John.

466
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:50,299
Look. I hate to do
this with a psychopath

467
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:51,623
sitting on the next tree,
but I thought this

468
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:52,667
- is what you wanted,
- Yes.

469
00:26:52,673 --> 00:26:53,743
- you and me together
- It is.

470
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:56,472
- Working as a team.
- John, seeing you like this,

471
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,474
seeing you fighting to survive,

472
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,078
this is the John Murphy
I fell in love with.

473
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,547
We're running through
the woods with a killer

474
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,282
about to become prisoners in order

475
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:08,885
to save our friends, and I find myself

476
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:11,287
wanting to rip your clothes off.

477
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:14,185
This...

478
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:16,793
As soon as this fight is over,

479
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:19,102
you will fall apart again.

480
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,422
- Emori...
- No.

481
00:27:26,508 --> 00:27:28,656
Trouble in paradise?

482
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:33,834
No. We're good here.

483
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,145
Tie her up.

484
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:55,353
All right, Abby. Fire it up.

485
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,071
Abby?

486
00:28:04,108 --> 00:28:07,326
Come on, sleeping beauty.
You got to see this.

487
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:08,966
Abby.

488
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,581
Abby.

489
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,565
Abby.

490
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:33,781
What the hell, Abby?

491
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:36,149
What are you taking?

492
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:38,524
Ohh...

493
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,469
Raven, I can explain.

494
00:28:42,814 --> 00:28:46,082
Do you remember the pain
after the City of Light?

495
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:49,570
Don't you talk to me about pain.

496
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:53,155
How does this work, you help Diyoza,

497
00:28:53,157 --> 00:28:54,982
and she gives you these?

498
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,911
You weren't scared she
was gonna hurt you.

499
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:03,199
You were scared she was
gonna cut you off.

500
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,655
Raven, I will stop.

501
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:07,996
Said by every addict ever!
Well, screw that.

502
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,744
I will not help you get your next fix.

503
00:29:12,844 --> 00:29:14,979
I didn't build this for a junkie.

504
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,048
Aagh!

505
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:20,995
Uh! aah!

506
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,212
Sorry, Raven.

507
00:29:23,214 --> 00:29:25,014
Aah! D'aagh!

508
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:27,380
I am so, so sorry.

509
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:39,929
There you are.

510
00:29:43,872 --> 00:29:44,988
You ok?

511
00:29:47,338 --> 00:29:50,158
We were happy once, weren't we?

512
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:52,663
Yeah.

513
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,483
We'll get back there, I promise.

514
00:30:09,968 --> 00:30:12,362
I don't want to be a killer anymore.

515
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:17,059
I don't want to take lives to save them.

516
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:19,902
Then don't.

517
00:30:19,908 --> 00:30:21,699
What if I say no

518
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:25,449
and people we care about die?

519
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:26,817
They might,

520
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:29,573
but everyone dies, Monty.

521
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:35,092
Let's show them how to live.

522
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,690
Will you still love me
if I'm just a farmer?

523
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:50,867
When the army marches, we stay here.

524
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:24,131
I heard screams, but I was too late.

525
00:31:29,248 --> 00:31:31,269
There's a hole in her glove.

526
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,061
Must have got in while
she was loading them up.

527
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:35,680
I'm sorry, Blodreina.

528
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,068
If I didn't use the gas and

529
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:38,737
the worms escaped into the bunker...

530
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:41,161
You made the right call, Indra.

531
00:31:42,044 --> 00:31:45,228
Octavia, I know this isn't a good time,

532
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,533
but I feel it's my duty to point out

533
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,570
that without the worms to
soften the battlefield,

534
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,803
the cost in lives will be too high.

535
00:31:52,805 --> 00:31:54,757
This is not a war we should fight.

536
00:31:54,763 --> 00:31:57,722
Hmm, thank you for your advice, Seda,

537
00:31:58,644 --> 00:32:01,434
but we weren't planning
on using the worms.

538
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:04,827
We are using their eggs.

539
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:09,155
Whoever wanted to make
this look like an accident,

540
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:12,222
they didn't know that, either.

541
00:32:15,027 --> 00:32:17,314
Find Clarke and Bellamy.

542
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:31,490
You're a good brother, Bellamy.

543
00:32:32,444 --> 00:32:34,691
I'm sorry that I thought I could...

544
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,970
Kill my sister?

545
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:43,854
The truth is,

546
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:46,728
if she was anybody else,

547
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:48,486
I would've beat you to it.

548
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:50,330
I don't know about that.

549
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:55,322
Maybe the old Bellamy, but not this one.

550
00:32:56,435 --> 00:33:00,129
Suddenly, I'm the one letting
my heart rule my head.

551
00:33:02,203 --> 00:33:03,835
Mama bears don't think.

552
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:06,576
They just protect their young.

553
00:33:09,177 --> 00:33:10,491
Uh!

554
00:33:10,497 --> 00:33:11,982
Whoa.

555
00:33:11,984 --> 00:33:13,895
- Octavia...
- Take her.

556
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:17,283
You're under arrest for the
murder of Kara Cooper.

557
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:19,289
What? No. This is insane.

558
00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:22,277
Is it? We weren't taking the worms.

559
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:24,728
The eggs are already
loaded in the rover,

560
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,708
so what was Cooper doing there?

561
00:33:30,602 --> 00:33:31,941
Careful, big brother,

562
00:33:31,947 --> 00:33:33,734
or I'll think you helped
her, and we don't have

563
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,920
enough prisoners to
settle this in the arena.

564
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:41,889
Oh, well. I guess we'll have
to settle for an execution.

565
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:44,469
- Uh...
- Let's go.

566
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:48,344
Keep Madi safe. Promise me. Uh!

567
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:49,858
I promise.

568
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,707
What happened to her?

569
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:22,529
You'll be happy to know
I didn't kill your pilot.

570
00:34:28,994 --> 00:34:31,365
We can't let Diyoza win.

571
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:33,406
What are you saying?

572
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:36,776
Promise me he won't suffer.

573
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:44,250
Hey, did he hurt you?

574
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:49,529
I'll be right over there if you need me.

575
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,089
- Tell me the truth.
- Why do you care?

576
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:06,139
You're the reason these people

577
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:07,692
are still alive, right?

578
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,074
Their sins are on you now.

579
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:28,666
Have you ever loved someone so much

580
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:32,033
that, no matter what they do to you

581
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,204
or themselves,

582
00:35:35,897 --> 00:35:37,509
you take it?

583
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,242
Mom or Dad?

584
00:35:46,315 --> 00:35:47,543
Mom.

585
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:51,551
Drank herself to death.

586
00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:58,792
The answer is yes.

587
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:15,709
Is it permanent?

588
00:36:15,711 --> 00:36:18,070
There's still some
residual tissue damage.

589
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:19,509
You won't be running any marathons,

590
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,104
but I can safely say that lung disease

591
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,546
is not what's gonna kill you.

592
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,948
Well done, Abby.

593
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:26,899
How soon can you do the others?

594
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:29,118
Colonel, we got company,

595
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,040
movement in the east woods.

596
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,462
Uh, scratch that. It's McCreary.

597
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:37,265
Looks like he's got prisoners.

598
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:40,063
Everything ok?

599
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:43,801
Yes...

600
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:51,007
But it's a pity you haven't
found the cure yet.

601
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,873
Ruthless.

602
00:36:54,374 --> 00:36:55,411
I like it.

603
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,715
You want your pills,

604
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:58,811
you'll keep it to yourself for now.

605
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:02,519
Do we understand each other?

606
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:17,403
Thank you for saving my life.

607
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:29,445
Hey, hey, it's McCreary.

608
00:38:00,564 --> 00:38:02,807
_

609
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,874
Omon gon oson.

610
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,332
Omon gon oson.

611
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:14,820
What about the girl... Madi?

612
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,580
She comes with us in
the rover as planned.

613
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,864
Omon gon oson.

614
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:23,032
Once she finds out about
it, the war will be over,

615
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,601
and we'll deal with it then.

616
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,047
Sorry, Blodreina.

617
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:30,382
Let him in.

618
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:34,717
Get some sleep. Tomorrow we ride.

619
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:39,440
So much for the 100.

620
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:43,419
- What?
- Let it go, Miller.

621
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:54,480
Don't threaten my people, Bellamy.

622
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,247
I can't let you kill Clarke, O.

623
00:38:59,275 --> 00:39:00,874
Here we go again,

624
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:04,279
pleading for the life of a traitor

625
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:06,458
who you love.

626
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,932
Mom and I used to share
our rations with you.

627
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:18,292
You mind?

628
00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:20,832
Only if you say the words.

629
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:25,671
Through the teeth and over the gums...

630
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:29,188
Not those words.

631
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:36,669
Omon gon oson. Say it.

632
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:38,994
Omon gon oson.

633
00:39:50,832 --> 00:39:52,666
Omon gon oson.

634
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,830
It's late, Bellamy.

635
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:04,245
If you've come here to beg, just do it.

636
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:06,583
I'm not here to beg.

637
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:10,306
I came here to tell you that I love you

638
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:12,524
very much,

639
00:40:13,353 --> 00:40:15,807
no matter what happens.

640
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:18,576
I hope you believe me.

641
00:40:22,098 --> 00:40:23,684
Get to the point.

642
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,459
I made a deal with Diyoza.

643
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:30,731
If Wonkru surrenders,

644
00:40:30,737 --> 00:40:33,390
we can all live in the valley.

645
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:38,709
How...

646
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,818
Something's wrong.

647
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,231
I... I can't breathe.

648
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:52,162
Help me. Help me.

649
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,792
What did you do?

650
00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:00,651
I dosed the bar

651
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,570
with Monty's algae.

652
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,764
I switched it with the
one we were sharing.

653
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,901
- Guard!
- Hey...

654
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:17,752
Hey...

655
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,904
Shh. You'll be ok.

656
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,433
By the time you wake up,

657
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:35,323
we'll be in the valley.

658
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:38,075
We will have peace.

659
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,900
My sister,

660
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:54,096
my responsibility.

661
